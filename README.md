for building the 'blog' image, just run the script `node build-app-image.js`)  

2) Run `npm install`    
3) Specify the ip address of this host under 'app-config.js'.  
4a) To start all, run `npm start`. Also supports stop, restart, and remove (to run remove, do `npm run remove`)  
4b) Otherwise to start either the app or the db, run `npm run start:app` or `npm run start:db`.  
Likewise, this also supports other operations.
